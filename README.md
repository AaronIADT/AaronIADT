## _GitHub Portfolio_


Hello and welcome to my GitHub Repository/portfolio. 
My name is Aaron Lynch and I am a Creative Computing student currently
finishing my final year at IADT. I have a huge interest in software development 
both frontend and backend with a particular interest in Virtual Reality development
as of recent times.
